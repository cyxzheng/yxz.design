                            I could talk more about my design stuff here, but
                            that will always change. I've had periods of time
                            where I was convinced that I would be a UX designer,
                            or a visual designer, or a motion designer, but
                            nowadays, I am simply a designer. I will do what it
                            takes to get the job done, and I'm thankful for the
                            different experiences I've had that gave me a broad
                            skillset.

                            I'm nowhere as weird or knowledgeable as the
                            original weird coffee person, James Hoffmann, but
                            considering I utilize two scales when making my
                            coffee (one to weigh the raw input of beans, one to
                            weigh the output of coffee), I'm probably weirder
                            than the average coffee drinker.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I don't actually like drinking straight espresso
                            though. Maybe I can't dial it in right. But I always
                            prefer a milk drink, like a cappuccino. Making latte
                            art is what makes coffee enjoyable for me.

                            Okay, so my fiance√© might actually say the only
                            thing I can make is pasta, but that's only partially
                            true. And besides, there's nothing wrong with pasta,
                            it's good! Though my personal preferences lean
                            towards noodle foods, I still enjoy making new
                            things and improving upon dishes I already know.

                <p>
                    With remote work slowly becoming the norm, I spend time
                    outdoors on some weekends. Hiking, camping, and snowboarding
                    in the winter months keeps me fresh, and makes me appreciate
                    the tactile feel of my keyboard when I eventually return to
                    my electronics.
