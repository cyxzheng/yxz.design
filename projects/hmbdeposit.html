                            The HMBradley Deposit Account is HMBradley's first
                            and core product. It was important as a fintech
                            banking platform to allow our users to, well, bank.
                            I led the design, and subsequent redesigns of the
                            deposit account as we grew, transitioned bank
                            partners, and built out our core to accommodate more

                            such as transfers, checking transaction details, and

                            A new account header also had to be designed for
                            Credit Card accounts.

                            the app now had a contextual component on it in the
                            form of a navigation bar and header set to an
                            account. For account-neutral actions, such as
                            checking account settings, having this added context
                            only served to confuse users and complicate things
                            for engineering.

                            logged in, they could now see every account, and

                            the entry point being the deposit account was just
                            because that was the first product we ever launched.

                            us transitioning bank partners. While the engineers
                            were working on the migration in the backend, we
                            slowly rolled out new design elements for HMBradley

                            stay compliant, but not too much that we would
