                            The HMBradley Deposit Account is HMBradley's first
                            and core product. As a fintech banking platform, it
                            was important to allow our users to actually do
                            their banking with us. I led the design, and
                            subsequent redesigns of the deposit account as we
                            grew, transitioned bank partners, and built out our
                            core to accommodate more features.

                            For launch, the two most important features were to
                            highlight our core offering, Savings Tiers, and to
                            allow users to do their banking.

                            The first live version of the deposit account was
                            very simple, with transactions front and center. No
                            frills, but all basic banking tasks could be done by
                            the user.

                            Savings Tiers was our way to reward users for good
                            financial habits. Behaviour in the current quarter
                            would affect next quarter's Savings Tier, so it was
                            imperative that this was spelled out in big letters
                            on the UI.

                            A new account header also had to be designed for
                            Credit Card accounts.

                            the app now had a contextual component on it in the
                            form of a navigation bar and header set to an
                            account. For account-neutral actions, such as
                            checking account settings, having this added context
                            only served to confuse users and complicate things
                            for engineering.

                        <p>
                            I designed and user-tested a new home page, with the
                            focus on figuring out if a dashboard view as an
                            entry point made more sense. Instead of seeing one
                            account at a time, the user can pick for themselves.

                            The intention was to put account-specific actions in
                            their respective accounts. That way there was never
                            a question of which account the user was in.

                            The old navigation structure was very parallel, and
                            the entry point being the deposit account was just
                            because that was the first product we ever launched.

                            User tests showed that having an entry point that
                            showed every path, and allowing users to choose,
                            made it easier for them to find what they needed. It
                            was also easier to build and maintain.

                            There was a period of weird in-between-ness due to
                            us transitioning bank partners. While the engineers
                            were working on the migration in the backend, we
                            slowly rolled out new design elements for HMBradley

                            stay compliant, but not too much that we would
