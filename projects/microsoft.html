                            This is my intern project from the summer of 2019,
                            where I was a Motion Design Intern on the Microsoft
                            365 Design Direction team. The existing experience
                            for showing users new updates to the M365 ecosystem
                            felt disjointed, uncool, and needed some TLC.

                            you're an IT admin with things to do, a link that
                            takes you out of your dashboard experience is
                            extremely annoying.

                            was presented with a blank canvas. I'm not very good
                            at coming up with brand new ideas completely on my
                            own, so I asked my PM, "what are some "must-knows"
                            for the user?". Each of these "must-knows" was
                            followed up with a quick UI mockup, intended to
                            solicit feedback from more knowledgeable

                            also come up with a system of alerting that's

                            attention grabber (like the sweep) can help draw
                            attention, and reinforce a system.

                            I put a bunch of dot badges on the dashboard, to
                            show that it won't overwhelm a user. As a
                            precaution, we also set a time of 45 days before the
                            dots disappear if the user doesn't dismiss them.
                            This time period was decided based on the longest
                            time between logins, which was 6 weeks. Further
                            tweaking, if needed, will be done based on future

                            tried to push the boundary in terms of how we could
                            use different illustrations, sizes, and orientations
                            to better onboard new users.

                            I worked with another intern to breathe life into an
                            error page. I learned that for even the smallest
                            features, multiple check-offs happen to ensure
                            design consistency. I shifted my illustration to an
                            isometric view, because my original work didn't
                            comply with the newly developed M365 illustration
                            styles.

                            While the push for dark mode was already happening,
                            the transition was just a simple page refresh. I had
                            some fun making a few different explorations to
                            offer a source of inspiration for future designers,
                            developers, and PMs on the dark mode project.

                            So I'm reflecting on this a further two years later,
                            and my thoughts have become a little more unhinged,
                            but still relevant.

                        <p>
                            Existing designs, style guidelines, rules... these
                            are all merely constructs. Nothing is ever set in
                            stone, so it's always more beneficial for everyone
                            if you put out work without worrying about
                            constraints. This was forgiveable as an intern
                            because internship work really doesn't matter, but
                            now, as an experienced designer, I should also keep
                            this mentality going into any future opportunities.
                            If I get fired because of it, it's probably a sign
                            that the company will die anyways because they
                            refuse to move forward.
